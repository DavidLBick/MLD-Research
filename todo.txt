1. speed up loading
2. split the current person data into train and test set
3. try this model on another person 
4. look for reasons why this accuracy wouldn't be real 
5. ranking function 
6. Should we run clustering/K-means with k=60 on our data to examine how 'pure' the classes are?

For week of 11/7 - 11/14:
1. Run the model without feature selection.
	a) Try with Convolution in 2 dimensions
	b) Try with Convolution only over time
	c) Try with Convolution only over channels (space)
2. Run the model with feature selection.
	- Select subset of best channels and then convolve in 1d over time
3. Switch from using ReLu activation to Sigmoid activation for our CNNs
4. Visualize the learned weights. Should reveal features
	- Should be 306x7? for 7 ms selection
5. Use 16 filters. See what each filter learns and see if the feature it learns matches up to a group of words (60 words fall in 12 groups of 5).
	- See at what time step each filter is most activated (expect 150ms or 400ms)
	- Look @ weights for features
6. When we apply the weights over the time convolution we will get 750 values. If we apply this over the channels we can visualize and compare with the original.
7. Maybe see if feature selection over individual points correlates to the features learned by the CNN
8. In the end, we will be comparing the results of CNN vs. results of regression that uses feature selection
